The region of variable male-female fold coverage from ~1-5 Mb on chr 8 was surprising.
To make sure this wasn't specific, repeated the analysis with reads mapped to X. hellerii.
Also ran 'quick' analyses with only 1 million from each sample.
Note that these 'quick' sets did not show the variable coverage variation at 1-5 Mb as the full sets.
